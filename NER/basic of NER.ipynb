    "NER, or Named Entity Recognition, is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying and categorizing named entities in text. Named entities refer to specific entities that have names, such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, and more. NER plays a crucial role in various NLP applications, including information extraction, question answering, and text summarization."
